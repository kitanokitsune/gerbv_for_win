Currently KNOWN BUGS

All OS:

If layer orientation modified with rotation and rendering mode is 'Fast' or
'Fast, with XOR' (GDK rendering) line22 macro apertures are not rotated
and not correctly displayed.

Reporting about macro parameters (obtained via analyze -> analyze visible
Gerber layers, and found in the Aperture definitions tab) incorrectly
reports the macro parameters found.
