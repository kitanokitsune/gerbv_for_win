Q:if the widget interface.main_window is destroyed, will it be NULL?
several combinations of loading/ unloading gerberfiles and destroying the search
dialog hint at it still exists and checking with if (interface.main_window) is not enough

A: without looking into details, destroying (freeing) a pointer never
sets it automatically to NULL. If it is important to know
whether a pointer is valid, one should do
free(ptr); ptr=NULL;
or even if(ptr) free(ptr); ptr = NULL;

What will follow is the list of dynamically allocated objects,
places where and when they are allocated and freed.

pnp files project files will only be included with the layer number and colour, not with the selected objects


instead of a log message I would like to use the statusbar, any objections? (Stefan?)
