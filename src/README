Gerbv is part of the gEDA Project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- About Gerbv

  *  Gerbv is a viewer for Gerber RS-274X files, Excellon drill files, and CSV
     pick-and-place files.  (Note:  RS-274D files are not supported.)
  *  Gerbv is a native Linux application, and it runs on many common Unix
     platforms.
  *  Gerbv is free/open-source software.
  *  The core functionality of Gerbv is located in a separate library
     (libgerbv), allowing developers to include Gerber
     parsing/editing/exporting/rendering into other programs.
  *  Gerbv is one of the utilities affiliated with the gEDA project, an
     umbrella organization dedicated to producing free software tools for
     electronic design.

-- Building Gerbv by downloading a release tarball

   1. Download source tarballs from http://gerbv.sourceforge.net
   2. Expand source by running gzip -dc <filename> | tar xf -
   3. Change to newly expanded directory
   4. Type './configure <switches>'.
      The following (Gerbv) switches are available to configure:
          * --help: Lists all configure options.
          * --enable-debug: Program will output lots of debug
              spew while running. (default = no -> no debug output
              by default.)
          * --enable-unit-mm: Set default unit for coordinates in
          4   status bar to mm (default = no -> units = inches
              by default.)
          * --enable-efence: Link with ElectricFence for malloc
              debugging (default = no -> efence off by default.)
          * --disable-update-desktop-database: Update desktop icon
              database after installation (default = no -> desktop
              icon installed by default.)
   5. Type 'make'
   6. Type 'make install'. Please note that if you want to install
      it in a system directory you have to 'su' first.
   7. Test by typing 'gerbv'

-- Building Gerbv by downloading from git

   1. Pull the source tree:
	'git clone ssh://git@geda-project.org:65/gerbv'
   2. Recreate all build system files in pulled directory:
	'sh autogen.sh'
   3. Follow steps 4-7 from "Building Gerbv by downloading a release tarball".
   4. Run 'git pull' in the cloned Gerbv directory to get the latest changes

--  Supported platforms
Gerbv has been built and tested on

    * Linux (from 2.2)
    * NetBSD/i386 (1.4.1)
    * NetBSD/Alpha (1.5.1)
    * Solaris (5.7 and 5.8)

-- Information for developers

Gerbv is split into a core functional library and a GUI portion. Developers
wishing to incorporate Gerber parsing/editing/exporting/rendering into other
programs are welcome to use libgerbv. Complete API documentation for libgerbv
is here, as well as many example programs using libgerbv.
