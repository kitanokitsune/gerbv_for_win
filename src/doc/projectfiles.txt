This is short description of the project file format used in gerbv
$Id$

The parser for project files is based on TinyScheme 1.33 
(http://tinyscheme.sourceforge.net/), therefore the syntax of project files
resembles Scheme syntax.

Current per-layer syntax is:
(define-layer! <layer no> <one or several name-value pairs>)

Current legal names are:
* filename: The value for filename is of course the filename with in ".
  Example: (cons 'filename "foo.proj")
* color: The value for color is a three element array with RGB values,
  where values can be between 0 and 65536.
  Example: (cons 'color #(1234 23444 12313))

Complete example for layer three is thus:
(define-layer! 3 (cons 'filename "foo.proj")(cons 'color #(1234 23444 12313)))

As in all Scheme syntax comments are between ; and end-of-line.
