The hellboard is a board created by DJ Delorie to exercise gEDA/PCB's ability
to render thermals.  It is included here since it may also exercise gerbv. 

The original .pcb file is included here.  To generate the Gerber files, use
this command:

pcb -x gerber hellboard.pcb

or open the PCB GUI, read the board in, and export Gerber files as usual.  

The original hellboard may be found in this e-mail:
