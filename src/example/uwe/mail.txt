Subject: gEDA: [Gerbv-0.16] Problem with Macro
Reply-To: geda-dev@seul.org

Hallo,

appended code comes from Eagle(4.13) from the RS274 processor for a supply
layer, where the "pads" layer has be left on during gerber production.
This  normally results in non-contacted layer, however here it is done to
explain the gerbv(and gcprevue8) misbehaviour.

The code flashes first (after the frame) both Obrounds, then the thermal
macro is flashed exactly over the Obround. One would expect to get a fully
filled Obround, with perhaps some of the thermal overlapping. However layer
inversion used in the thermal macro is still active and leads to reversed
areas inside the Obround. This is wrong

Bye
